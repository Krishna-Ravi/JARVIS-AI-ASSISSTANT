# JARVIS-AI-ASSISTANT (v1)
# J.A.R.V.I.S - Just A Rather Very Intelligent System
Jarvis, a simple personal assistant

In this mini project, I've attempted to create a very simple Personal Assistant that understands speech and replies accordingly. This project is based on simple python code.

Jarvis-Ai-Assistant can perform tasks like:


* Krishna said: Hey Jarvis

* J.A.R.V.I.S :  hello sir, what can i do for you?


* Krishna said: What's the time

* J.A.R.V.I.S :  The current time is 12.32 am


* Krishna said: What's the date

* J.A.R.V.I.S :  Today's date is 02-06-2020


* Krishna said: Remember that

* J.A.R.V.I.S :  What do you want me to remember sir?

* Krishna said : Your name is Jarvis!

* J.A.R.V.I.S :  You told me to remember that "your name is Jarvis",I remember that now.

* Krishna said: Do you know anything

* J.A.R.V.I.S : You have said me to remember that "your name is Jarvis"

* Krishna said: Take screenshot

* J.A.R.V.I.S : Done

So these are few tasks Jarvis (v1) can perform, explore the code for more tasks in detail.
